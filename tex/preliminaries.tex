\label{chap:preliminaries}
In this chapter, we will introduce the notation that will be used in this thesis.

We denote by $x \leftarrowS S$ a value $x$ sampled uniformly at random from the set $S$.
We denote the power set of $S$ by $2^S$.

When working with a probability distribution $D$, $x \leftarrowS D$ denotes the random sampling of a value according to $D$.
We also denote the probability of some value $x \in D$ as $Pr_D[x]$ or $Pr[x]$ if the distribution is clear from context.
We define $U_n$ as the uniform distribution over bit strings of length $n$.

In code samples, we denote $x \leftarrow a$ as assignment of value $a$ to variable $x$.
When working with sorted sequences, such as arrays or strings, we use pythonic slicing notation.
Given a sequence $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{n-1})$ of length $n$, we use the following slicing operations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $x[i] = x_i$,
  \item $x[i:j] = (x_i, x_{i+1}, \dots, x_{j-1})$,
  \item $x[i:] = x[i:n] = (x_i, x_{i+1}, \dots, x_{n-1})$.
\end{itemize}

We will use $x \leftarrow \epsilon$ as the empty value assignment.
We also use the infix operator $\oplus \colon \{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n,~ a \oplus b$ for the exclusive or of values $a$ and $b$.
The infix concatenation operator $|| \colon X^n \times X^m \rightarrow X^{n+m},~ a||b$ appends the value or sequence $b$ to the value or sequence $a$. 

The variable $\lambda$ denotes the security parameter used in cryptographic primitives or steganographic protocols.
We denote by $\mu(\lambda)$ a function negligible in $\lambda$, i.e., for every integer $c$ there exists an integer $c_0$ such that for every $\lambda > c_0$,
$$|\mu(\lambda)| < \frac{1}{\lambda^c}.$$

In general, the hiddentext in a steganographic protocol is a bit string $m \in \{0,1\}^*$.
In this thesis, however, we use sequences of Unicode characters as hiddentexts.
We denote the set of Unicode characters as $\mathcal{U}$ and hiddentext messages $m \in \mathcal{U}^*$ as strings of Unicode characters.
