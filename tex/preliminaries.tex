\label{chap:preliminaries}
In this chapter, we will introduce notation that will be used in this thesis.

We denote $x \leftarrowS S$ as a value $x$ sampled uniformly at random from the set $S$.
When working with a probability distribution $D$, $x \leftarrowS D$ denotes the random sampling of a value according to $D$.
We also denote the probability of some value $x \in D$ as $Pr_D[x]$.
We define $U_n$ as the uniform distribution over bitstrings of length $n$.
For a given set $S$, we denote the power set of $S$ as $\mathcal{P}(S)$.

In code samples, we denote $x \leftarrow a$ as assignment of value $a$ to variable $x$.
When working with sorted sequences such as arrays or strings we use pythonic slicing notation.
Given a sequence $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{n-1})$ of length $n$, we use the following slicing operations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $x[i] = x_i$
  \item $x[i:j] = (x_i, x_{i+1}, \dots, x_{j-1})$
  \item $x[i:] = x[i:n] = (x_i, x_{i+1}, \dots, x_{n-1})$
\end{itemize}

We will use $x \leftarrow \epsilon$ as the empty value assignment.
We also use the infix operator $\oplus \colon \{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n,~ a \oplus b$ for the exclusive or of values $a$ and $b$.
The infix concatenation operator $|| \colon X^n \times X^m \rightarrow X^{n+m},~ a||b$ appends the value or sequence $b$ to the value or sequence $a$. 

The variable $\lambda$ denotes the security parameter used in cryptographic primitives or steganographic protocols.
In general, the hiddentext in a steganographic protocol is a bit string $m \in \{0,1\}^*$.
In this thesis however, we use sequences of unicode characters as hiddentexts.
We denote the set of unicode characters as $\mathcal{U}$ and hiddentext messages $m \in \mathcal{U}^*$ as strings of unicode characters.
